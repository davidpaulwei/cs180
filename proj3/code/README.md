## Project 3

**Face Morphing and Modelling a Photo Collection**&emsp;[Webpage](https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj3/) | [My Code](https://github.com/davidpaulwei/cs180/tree/main/proj3/code)  

   In the first part of this project, I morphed two face images using **Affine Transformation**. I obtained 100 correspondences for each of the two faces and computed their average coordinates. **Triangulation** was conducted on the correspondences and for each triangle, **Affine Matrixes** were generated to stretch the triangles from the original image to the Midway image. I used **Cross Dissolve** to bind the color. I furtherly generated a sequence of 51 morphed images using different **Morph Weight** to produce the morphing GIF. In the second part, I computed the mean face of 12 Brazilian faces, and stretched my face into the shape of the mean face. I also computed the mean face of 12 smiling Brazilian faces to add a smile on my grim portrait.

Finished on Oct 2, 2024.
