## Project 4

**Stitching Photo Mosaics**&emsp;[Webpage](https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj4/) | [My Code](https://github.com/davidpaulwei/cs180/tree/main/proj4/code)    

    Project 4 consists two parts: **Image Warping and Mosaicing** (Part A) and **Feature Matching for Autostitching** (Part B). In Part A, I rectified images by warping them using **Perspective Transform**. The transformation matrix was calculated by coordinates of correspondences before and after their transformation.I also blended pairs of images into **mosaics**. This is done by warping one of the images so that its transformed correspondences aligns with the correspondences of the other. Part B is yet to be finished.

Finished on Oct 14, 2024.
