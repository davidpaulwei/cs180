## Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains my projects for UC Berkeley's course [COMPSCI 180 - Intro to Computer Vision and Computational Photography](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa24/) on fall 2024 semester. For detailed introduction, visit [website](https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/).  

1. **Project 1: Colorizing the _Prokudin-Gorskii_ Photo Collection** &emsp; [Website](https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj1/) | [My Code](https://github.com/davidpaulwei/cs180/tree/main/proj1/code) | [Github Folder](https://github.com/davidpaulwei/cs180/tree/main/proj1)  
   _Prokudin-Gorskii_ photographed the Russian Empire using black-and-white negatives with red, green and blue filters, hoping future technologies could stack the three layers to produce colored image. I take the digitized negatives of _Prokudin-Gorskii_'s work to produce the RGB color image. The original three color layers from _Prokudin-Gorskii_'s work are not accurately aligned, so I designed an alignment algorithm using **Image Pyramid** and **Edge Detection** to preprocess the layers before stacking them together.
