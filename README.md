## Computer Vision Projects
This repository contains my projects for UC Berkeley's course "COMPSCI 180:  Intro to Computer Vision and Computational Photography" for fall 2024 semester. For detailed introduction, visit [website](https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/).

Here is a brief introduction of the projects

1. **[Project 1](https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj1/): Colorizing the _Prokudin-Gorskii_ Photo Collection**
   _Prokudin-Gorskii_ photographed the Russian Empire using black-and-white negatives with red, green and blue filters, hoping future technologies could stack the three layers to produce colored image. I take the digitized negatives of _Prokudin-Gorskii_'s work to produce the RGB color image. The original three color layers from _Prokudin-Gorskii_'s work are not accurately aligned, so I designed an alignment algorithm to preprocess the layers before stacking them together.
