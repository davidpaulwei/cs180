            : Colorizing the <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i> Photo Collection<br></b>
            <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i> photographed the Russian Empire using black-and-white negatives with red, green and blue filters,
            hoping future technologies could stack the three layers to produce colored image.
            I took the digitized negatives of <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i>'s work to produce the RGB color image.
            The original three color layers from <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i>'s work were not accurately aligned, 
            so I designed an alignment algorithm using <b>Image Pyramid</b> and <b>Edge Detection</b> to preprocess the layers before stacking them together.

            <b><a href= "https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj2/">Project 2</a>
            : Fun with Filters and Frequencies<br></b>
            By applying filters and analyzing frequencies, images can be processed and combined in interesting ways.
            In the first part of this project, edge detection is conducted by applying the <b>Finite Difference Filter</b>. 
            <b>Gaussian Filter</b> is applied to get rid of the unnecessary wrinkles. 
            Then, images are sharpened by stacking its edges onto itself.
            The second part of this project consists of two image binding tasks. 
            The first task generates Hybrid Image by adding the high frequency of one image to the low frequency of another.
            Both successful and failing attempts are introduced.
            The second task blends images by applying the <b>Gaussian Stack</b> and the <b>Laplacian Stack</b>.

            <b><a href= "https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj3/">Project 3</a>
            : Face Morphing and Modelling a Photo Collection<br></b>
            In the first part of this project, I morphed two face images using <b>Affine Transformation</b>.
            I obtained 100 correspondences for each of the two faces and computed their average coordinates.
            <b>Triangulation</b> was conducted on the correspondences and for each triangle, <b>Affine Matrixes</b> were generated to stretch the triangles from the original image to the Midway image.
            I used <b>Cross Dissolve</b> to bind the color. I furtherly generated a sequence of 51 morphed images using different <b>Morph Weight</b> to produce the morphing GIF.
            In the second part, I computed the mean face of 12 Brazilian faces, and stretched my face into the shape of the mean face.
            I also computed the mean face of 12 smiling Brazilian faces to add a smile on my grim portrait.
