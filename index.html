            : Colorizing the <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i> Photo Collection<br></b>
            <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i> photographed the Russian Empire using black-and-white negatives with red, green and blue filters,
            hoping future technologies could stack the three layers to produce colored image.
            I take the digitized negatives of <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i>'s work to produce the RGB color image.
            The original three color layers from <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i>'s work are not accurately aligned, 
            so I designed an alignment algorithm using <b>Image Pyramid</b> and <b>Edge Detection</b> to preprocess the layers before stacking them together.

            : Fun with Filters and Frequencies<br></b>
            By applying filters and analyzing frequencies, images can be processed and combined in interesting ways.
            In the first part of this project, edge detection is conducted by applying the <i>Finite Difference Filter</i>. 
            <i>Gaussian Filter</i> is applied to get rid of the unnecessary wrinkles. 
            Then, images can be sharpened by stacking its edges onto itself.
            The second part of this project consists of two image binding tasks. 
            The first task generates Hybrid Image by adding the high frequency of one image to the low frequency of the another.
            Both successful and failing attempts are introduced.
            The second task blends images by applying the <i>Gaussian Stack</i> and the <i>Laplacian Stack</i>.
