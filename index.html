            <b><a href= "https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj1/">Project 1</a>
            : Colorizing the <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i> Photo Collection<br></b>
            <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i> photographed the Russian Empire using black-and-white negatives with red, green and blue filters,
            hoping future technologies could stack the three layers to produce colored image.
            I took the digitized negatives of <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i>'s work to produce the RGB color image.
            The original three color layers from <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i>'s work were not accurately aligned, 
            so I designed an alignment algorithm using <b>Image Pyramid</b> and <b>Edge Detection</b> to preprocess the layers before stacking them together.

            <b><a href= "https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj2/">Project 2</a>
            : Fun with Filters and Frequencies<br></b>
            By applying filters and analyzing frequencies, images can be processed and combined in interesting ways.
            In the first part of this project, edge detection is conducted by applying the <b>Finite Difference Filter</b>. 
            <b>Gaussian Filter</b> is applied to get rid of the unnecessary wrinkles. 
            Then, images are sharpened by stacking its edges onto itself.
            The second part of this project consists of two image binding tasks. 
            The first task generates Hybrid Image by adding the high frequency of one image to the low frequency of another.
            Both successful and failing attempts are introduced.
            The second task blends images by applying the <b>Gaussian Stack</b> and the <b>Laplacian Stack</b>.

            <b><a href= "https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj3/">Project 3</a>
            : Face Morphing and Modelling a Photo Collection<br></b>
            In the first part of this project, I morphed two face images using <b>Affine Transformation</b>.
            I obtained 100 correspondences for each of the two faces and computed their average coordinates.
            <b>Triangulation</b> was conducted on the correspondences and for each triangle, <b>Affine Matrixes</b> were generated to stretch the triangles from the original image to the Midway image.
            I used <b>Cross Dissolve</b> to bind the color. I furtherly generated a sequence of 51 morphed images using different <b>Morph Weight</b> to produce the morphing GIF.
            In the second part, I computed the mean face of 12 Brazilian faces, and stretched my face into the shape of the mean face.
            I also computed the mean face of 12 smiling Brazilian faces to add a smile on my grim portrait.

            <p>
                Project 4 consists two parts: <b>Image Warping and Mosaicing</b> 
                (Part A) and <b>Feature Matching for Autostitching</b> (Part B).
            </p>
            <p>
                In Part A, I rectified images using <b>Perspective Transform</b>. 
                I manually selected correspondences on the images, and warped them
                so that their transformed correspondences form a rectangle.
                I also produced <b>mosaics images</b> by blending pairs of images that 
                overlap with each other. First, I manually matched a few pixels that 
                represent the same corner of an object on the two images. Then, I 
                treated these pixel matches as correspondences, and warped the first 
                image so that after warping, the correspondences on the first image 
                aligns with the correspondences on the second images. In this way, 
                the same objects on the two images would match. Finally, I conducted 
                <b>Alpha Blend</b> on the output mosaic to erase the edge between the 
                two images. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In Part B, I also produced mosaic images, 
                only this time instead of manually matching the pixels, the pixel 
                matches are automatically detected and selected.
                Corners serve as great symbols of objects on an image, so I used 
                <b>Harris Corner Detector</b> to find the corners on the images, and 
                treat them as interest points. Then, I used 
                <b>Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression (ANMS)</b> to select a few interest 
                points that are not only high in "corner strength", but also as 
                uniformly distributed in the image as possible. They are the potential 
                correspondences. Later, I matched the potential correspondences using 
                <b>Feature Descriptors</b>. If the best match of a 
                potential correspondence did not score significantly higher than its 
                second-best match, I would abandon this pixel. The matched pixels
                still may contain error. I found the optimal set of matches using the 
                idea of <b>Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC)</b>. At last, 
                similar to Part A, I used the optimal matches to conduct perspective 
                transform on the first image so that it aligns with the second image, 
                and blended the overlapping region to erase the edge.
