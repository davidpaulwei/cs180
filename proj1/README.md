## Project 1

**Colorizing the _Prokudin-Gorskii_ Photo Collection**&emsp;[Webpage](https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj1/) | [My Code](https://github.com/davidpaulwei/cs180/tree/main/proj1/code)

_Prokudin-Gorskii_ photographed the Russian Empire using black-and-white negatives with red, green and blue filters, hoping future technologies could stack the three layers to produce colored image. I take the digitized negatives of _Prokudin-Gorskii_'s work to produce the RGB color image. The original three color layers from _Prokudin-Gorskii_'s work are not accurately aligned, so I designed an alignment algorithm using **Image Pyramid** and **Edge Detection** to preprocess the layers before stacking them together. 

Finished on Sept 9, 2024.
